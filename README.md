## ‚öôÔ∏è My process  

I approached this project with a **desktop-first workflow**.  

1. Built the layout for desktop screens first, using `vh`-based widths (`.box { width: 40vh; }` and `.element { width: 30vh; }`).  
2. Used `<br>` tags for spacing between elements.  
3. Added a `@media (max-width: 430px)` query to handle mobile view.  
4. Focused on hover states and a dark theme with green accent color.
