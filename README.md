## ‚öôÔ∏è My process  

I approached this project with a **desktop-first workflow**.  

1. Built the layout for desktop screens first, using `vh`-based widths (`.box { width: 40vh; }` and `.element { width: 30vh; }`).  
2. Used `<br>` tags for spacing between elements.  
3. Added a `@media (max-width: 430px)` query to handle mobile view.  
4. Focused on hover states and a dark theme with green accent color.

### üõ† Built with
- Semantic HTML5 (basic structure)  
- CSS custom properties  
- Flexbox  
- Desktop-first workflow with `max-width` media query  
- Hover & focus states  

---

### üìö What I learned
- How to apply a desktop-first workflow and then adjust for mobile.  
- Practiced using `vh` units for card widths (instead of `%` or `px`).  
- Learned how to use media queries like `@media (max-width: 430px)` to change layout for smaller screens.  

Code sample from my project:
```css
.element:hover,
.element:focus-visible {
  cursor: pointer;
  background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
  outline: none;
}
